<!-- CODE debugging

A lot of our programming can come up with a lot of errors.
Yeah! we have our own method to correct them sometimes, we search for the error on Google
and most of the time they have the right answer for you
HOWEVER
if your code runs perfectly but the output is not the one you were expecting. You will see that 
the program won't tell you what kind of error is happening, it will just run and every functions you made
will run.
For this situations is very important to know how to debug programs, and in Javascript is more dynamic to do this
because it makes you debug and see the result almost inmediately in your page.
If you want to learn how to debug I will definitely recommend to start doing it on JavaScript

-->

<!-- Here I will show a list of all the debugger JavaScript offers, there might be more other options
However, these are the most important wants every front-end developer needs to master -->

<!-- The console.log() Method -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>My First Web Page</h1>

<script>
a = 5;
b = 6;
c = a + b;
console.log(c);
</script>

</body>
</html>

<!-- This is a simple example of using console.log(). the variable c is the result of adding a and b together
and if you want to see the result of it you can output it on the webpage or just use console.log().
right click your page, go to inspects and select the tab console. It will show the result of your math

This can be use to place data that you want to check if it is obtaining the right value-->

<!-- Debugger Keyword -->

<!-- Using this debugger keyword helps you to stop on a certain part of your code to see if everythin is working 
propertly before executin the other parts of the code.
For example -->
<script>
var x = 15 * 5;
debugger;
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x;
</script>

<!-- this function will stop on the 2 line before the innerhtml runs. It will show you what the variable x
is containing before it displays it to the html.  -->


<!-- The most important way to debug a program is to use the DevTools  
This can be something tedious as first but once you know what you are doing when you use it, it makes it
very simple to debug programs that have a lot of functions.
There are some options in the DevTools where you can go through every line of the code, skip functions
go into a function, etc.

I usually use this everytime I need to debug something because of how efficient it is.-->


<!-- FUN FACT :
     Debugging is the process of testing, finding, and reducing bugs (errors) in computer programs. 
     The first known computer bug was a real bug (an insect) stuck in the electronics. -->
