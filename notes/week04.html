<!-- 
In order to collect a lot of inputs or just one input from the user, using Forms helps a lot in HTML to make this possible.
For example:
When a user tries to sign up in a webpage, the program behind it needs to take that action and those values and store it somewhere 
in the data. For example, you can use databases in order to store those information the user inputs. -->


<form action="/phpmotors/accounts/index.php" method="post"> <!-- action_page.php -->
  
            
    <ul class="container">
    <li>
    <label for="fName">First Name</label>
    <input type="text" placeholder="Enter first name" name="clientFirstname">
    </li>
    <li>
    <label for="lName">Last Name</label>
    <input type="text" placeholder="Enter last name" name="clientLastname">
    </li>
    <li>
    <label for="email">Email</label>
    <input type="text" placeholder="Enter Email" name="clientEmail">
    </li>
    <li>
    <label for="password">Password</label>
    <input type="password" id="password" placeholder="Enter Password" name="clientPassword">
    </li>
    <li>
    <input type="submit" name="submit" id="regbtn" value="Register">
    <input type="hidden" name="action" value="register">
    </li>          
    </ul>
    <!-- <button id="but" type="submit">Register</button>   -->
</form>

<!-- 
This is a login output for HTML that is contained in a Form using the method "Post" in order to post those results and save them.

And this is how you store the data: -->

<!-- Filter and store the data -->

            $invMake = filter_input(INPUT_POST, 'invMake');
            $invModel = filter_input(INPUT_POST, 'invModel');
            $invDescription = filter_input(INPUT_POST, 'invDescription');
            $invImage = filter_input(INPUT_POST,'invImage');
            $invThumbnail = filter_input(INPUT_POST, 'invThumbnail');
            $invPrice = filter_input(INPUT_POST,'invPrice');
            $invStock = filter_input(INPUT_POST,'invStock');
            $invColor = filter_input(INPUT_POST, 'invColor');
            $selectOption = filter_input(INPUT_POST, 'classiOption');
 
<!-- Forms are very important in HTML, and as you keep making apps that will need to store information for the user, this is something you will constantly be using. -->


<!-- Object Oriented Programming 

- OOP is faster and easier to execute
- OOP provides a clear structure for the programs
- OOP helps to keep the JavaScript code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug
- OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time


Using Object Oriented Programming will make everything easier for you to write code and also if you are constantly making a lot of programms you can copy some functions
that will help you to use them in many different occasions.

-->

<!-- This following code is an example of a class in javascript / very useful when using OOP. -->
<script>
class ClassName {
    constructor() { ... }
    method_1() { ... }
    method_2() { ... }
    method_3() { ... }
    }
  }
</script>

<!-- Objects are very important to use in OOP and you can make also interact with it and add some extra values -->
<script>
var car = "Fiat";
var car = {type:"Fiat", model:"500", color:"white"};
</script>


<!-- NOW we know about classes and objects. You can see it in this way: and object can be a Car and a function is to know what the car can do
FOR EXAMPLE:
If can a car can not just moving forward but also reverse, you will make a function called reverse that will take the object car.
This is a good way to understand their functionality and organize your code -->



<!-- MODERN JAVASCRIPT DEVELOPMENT

Modern javascript is an amazing tool that helps developers to make their code easy to interact with the many different libraries Javascript offers.
In my personal oppinion, I would like to explain more about it; however, it comes to the point that there are so many functionalites I can use through this
that I feel a begginer at it still. 

DOM and Jquery are very great tools every developer needs to udnerstand. It will make posible for you to write code faster and make it more dynamic.

Very usefult for programs like I mentiones before (log in and sign up) or programs like ToDo tasks
