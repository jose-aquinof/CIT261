Objects
An object is what is sounds like: an Object!. For example:
A car can be an object and this car can have properties like color of the car, brand, etc.
On code each object that you create can have its own properties as well and you can access to it quickly.
You can access object properties in two ways:
objectName.propertyName
or
objectName["propertyName"]

Events
When JavaScript is used in HTML pages, JavaScript can “react” on these events
And HTML event is something that the browser can do or the user can.
For example: -->
<!-- HTML button :--> <button onclick="document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML = Date()">The time is?</button> 
<!-- HTML input:--> <button onclick="this.innerHTML = Date()">The time is?</button>
